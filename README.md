# Arduino controlled by Javascript
### In this project, you can control 3 LEDs with an Arduino via Browser, using only NodeJS! Follow along with this guide so you can set up this project on your PC.

## 0. Basic Setup
### Before doing anything, you need to clone this repo on your machine. This guide will not go in-depth about the coding used or the theory behind everything, it'll be much more pratical.
### Nonetheless, if you have an intermediate knowledge in front-end dev with HTML/CSS/JS and some basic understanding of Electronics and Arduino you'll be able to understand and learn from this program/guide.
### To clone this repo, you will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) [installed and configured](https://techpp.com/2021/09/03/install-git-on-windows-guide/). After installing it, open Git Bash and go to a desired folder where you want your project (for example, the Documents folder).
### Then, you will clone this repository with the following command and we will be fine to start:
	git clone https://github.com/jv-aquino/Arduino-Javascript.git

------------

## 1. Arduino Circuit
### You will need:
- 3 LEDs (with different colors, if possible);
- 3 3 resistors of 220 Î©
- 1 Protoboard;
- 1 Arduino;
- Some cables
### Take the materials above and assemble the circuit following the image:
![Circuit Image](./arduino/circuit.png)

------------

## 2. Arduino Program
### To write the .ino program - which will be loaded in the Arduino so it can wait for the instructions later - you will need to [install the Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/#legacy-ide-18x)*
*in this case we are using the legacy version which is supported by pretty much any computer, but you can also use the 2.0 version if you want to
